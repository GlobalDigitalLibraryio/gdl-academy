## File formats
There are two preferred document and file formats for the different types of e-books and content (storybooks, textbooks, etc) and other resources that are committed to the GDL platform:
* [EPUB3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB)
* [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)

In addition, for print-ready versions of the content, we ask for documents in PDF (PDF 1.4 – 1.7). 

All text needs to be encoded in UTF-8. This includes both metadata and textual content.
