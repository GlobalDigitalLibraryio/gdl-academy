# GDL Import guidelines
The GDL will collect existing high quality open educational reading resources, and make them available on the web, mobile and for print. The platform will also facilitate translation and localization of these resources to more than 300 languages.

If your organization is developing reading resources in your project you can contribute by committing your content to the GDL. Content will only be published on the GDL platform after each title has been subject to quality assurance and proofreading.

The guidelines consist of six steps to consider before submitting your content to the GDL platform. Each step is explained in more detail later in the document:

* Be sure that you own the rights to your content or that the content is reused under a free license. This is important and pertains to both text and illustrations.
* Be sure that the content complies with common accessibility guidelines for web content.
* Be sure that the content complies with the GDL minimum standards for quality assurance
* Release your content under a free license, like Creative Commons. This will allow others to reuse and translate your books into new languages.
* Publish your books in EPUB or HTML format to ensure that the books can be imported into the GDL platform.
* Add basic metadata to your books, this will make it easy for others to find your resources.
