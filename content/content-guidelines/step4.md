## Content quality assurance
The GDL quality assurance (QA) standards will serve as minimum criteria for accepting or rejecting various types of reading books submitted for upload to the GDL. Be sure that the quality assurance parameters used in your content development process align with the GDL minimum standards.

The two main content categories for the GDL are Classroom Materials and Library Materials, with different QA standards for the two categories.
