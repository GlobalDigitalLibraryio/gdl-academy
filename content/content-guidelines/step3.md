## Accessibility guidelines
The GDL project will follow the principles of universal design and accessibility and will have a strong focus on making all content generally accessible, including for those with print disabilities, i.e. blindness or low vision, severe dyslexia, or mobility impairment.

The GDL platform will be compliant to 55 of the 61 requirements in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). The WCAG 2.0 Guidelines covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible. GDL will follow these guidelines to secure that the content is accessible for all users. By following these guidelines one will also often make the web content more usable in general.

We ask all projects that develop content for the GDL platform to comply to common accessibility guidelines EPUB in addition to WCAG (e.g. [EPUB Accessibility 1.0](http://www.idpf.org/epub/a11y/accessibility.html), [EPUB 3 Accessibility Guidelines](https://idpf.github.io/a11y-guidelines/), and [Top Tips for Creating Accessible EPUB3 Files](https://home.digitallibrary.io/content-creation/)).
