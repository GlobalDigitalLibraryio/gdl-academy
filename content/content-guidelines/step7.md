## Metadata
For GDL content, we have defined a common set of metadata. This will ensure quality and allow for the GDL platform to present resources with a consistent set of metadata. At the same time, it will make it easier and more predictable for projects that want to contribute by adding their resources to the GDL collection.  

If all GDL content is described in a consistent and uniform manner, our searches will return more relevant results, and it will become easier for users to find the exact educational resources they need at the precise moment they need them.

The Global Digital Library metadata is based on the LRMI Specification Version 1.1. In furtherance of its goal of interoperating with other specifications, the LRMI project has been inspired by other projects with similar visions.
