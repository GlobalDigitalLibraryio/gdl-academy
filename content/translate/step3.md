## Step by step guide to translation
We have created a step by step guide with 8 steps that will help you get going with translation. If you are new as a GDL translator, this guide will help you get up to speed quickly.

We would encourage you to create a new browser window with [digitallibrary.io](https://digitallibrary.io) to follow the guide step by step.

## Step 1 of 8
When you have found the book you would like to translate klick “Translate this book”.
