You will then be in the translation workspace. Use the following procedure to translate one page and move to the next:
* The original text on the top
* You fill in your translation in “Enter translation here” and click “Save”
* If there is more than one line of text on the page you will do the same for all sentences.
* When you have finished translating one page, close the translation workspace by clicking the “x”.
* Move the next page by clicking the arrow on the far right in the page navigation.
* Start translating the next page by clicking the icon at the top left.
