## WHO CAN USE THE GLOBAL DIGITAL LIBRARY?
The GDL is aimed at many different types of users and the platform is open for everyone.

Intended users include:
* Ministries of education
* School managers and teachers
* Donor agencies and their implementing partners
* International and national non-governmental organizations
* Local publishers
* Digital distributors and content providers
* Households in developing countries

## WHO IS BEHIND THE GLOBAL DIGITAL LIBRARY?
The GDL-platform is a collaborative endeavor involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders in order to be truly successful and widely used. It is being built based on existing quality learning resources provided from a variety of initiatives. The content pool will expand over time through discovery and sharing of more existing quality content, translations and localizations of the platformâ€™s content, as well as additions of newly created content. The Platform will be designed both for direct use by a variety of user groups and for integration with existing initiatives in the field.

The Global Digital Library is part of The Global Book Alliance, an international effort involving multiple stakeholders working to transform book development, procurement and distribution to ensure that no child is without books. The mission of the Global Book Alliance is to guarantee that children everywhere have the books and learning materials they need to learn to read and read to learn.

The idea to develop a Global Digital Library for reading resources came from All Children Reading: a Grand Challenge for Development (ACR) in 2014. ACR and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) subsequently conducted joint feasibility work in 2015 and 2016, which outlined important parameters for such a project.
